# C Programming Practice Programs

This folder contains a curated collection of **C programs** ranging from formatted output and basic calculations to demonstrations of all major error types including syntax, semantic, logical, runtime, and linker errors. Each program is documented with structured metadata for clarity and academic use.

|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Escape Sequences and Formatted Output in C                         | Demonstrates use of newline, tab, quote, backslash, alert, vertical tab, and percent escape sequences. |
| 2    | Pattern Printing using printf in C                                 | Prints a complex symbol pattern using formatted printf statements.         |
| 3    | Centimeter to Inch Converter                                       | Converts a distance in centimeters to inches using the conversion factor 2.54. |
| 4    | Area Calculator for Triangle, Square, Rectangle, and Circle        | Calculates and displays areas for multiple shapes based on user inputs.    |
| 5    | Integer Formatting and Output Width Demonstration                  | Demonstrates field width, precision, padding, and alignment for integer output. |
| 6    | Demonstration of Unary Arithmetic Operators in C                   | Illustrates working of pre/post increment and decrement operations.        |
| 7    | Demonstration of Relational Operators in C                         | Compares integers using <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != operators.                |
| 8    | Demonstration of Logical Operators in C                            | Shows how logical AND, OR, and NOT operate in condition evaluation.        |
| 9    | Demonstration of Relational, Logical, and Bitwise Operators in C   | Combines logical, relational, and increment operators across expressions.  |
| 10   | Demonstration of Syntax Error – Missing Semicolon                  | Highlights a missing semicolon in a printf causing a compile-time error.   |
| 11   | Demonstration of Syntax Error – Invalid Condition in while()       | Demonstrates invalid use of non-expression in a while loop condition.      |
| 12   | Demonstration of Run-Time Error – Division by Zero                 | Causes division by zero at runtime and shows how to handle it safely.      |
| 13   | Demonstration of Linker Error – Incorrect Main Function Declaration | Shows case sensitivity issue with `Main()` leading to linker error.       |
| 14   | Demonstration of Logical Error – Misplaced Semicolon in for Loop   | Demonstrates how an extra semicolon after `for` causes incorrect output.   |
| 15   | Demonstration of Semantic Error – Assignment to an Expression      | Assigns value to an expression, which is not allowed in C.                 |
| 16   | Demonstration of Semantic and Syntax Errors – Type and Declaration | Shows undeclared identifiers, type mismatches, and I/O format issues.      |
| 17   | Demonstration of Multiple Errors – Syntax, Semantic, and Logical   | Contains incorrect macros, invalid identifiers, assignment issues, and undeclared variables. |

## How to Use

Compile and run any program using:
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
